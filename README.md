This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

# Outline

Please build a single page application that lets users vote through the Polls
API. Documentation for the API is available at http://docs.pollsapi.apiary.io/. Refer to the documentation for details on how to query the API.

# Features

- [List of questions page](http://pasteboard.co/8AReDrPvo.jpg)
- [Question detail page](http://pasteboard.co/8ARC7212L.jpg)
- Optional stretch goal: Create new question page

# Notes

- You can use libraries and frameworks as you see fit.
- You can use starter projects such as
  [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
- Commit all changes to a Git repository and follow
  [good commit message practice](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).
- Don't spend more than a couple of hours. The goal is to show how you work,
  not to deliver production-ready code.
- Focus on good application structure, not a working but hacky solution.
- Styles aren't important but your solution needs to work on mobile and desktop.
- Make sure there's a README with instructions on how to get started.
- When you're done, send us a link to the Git repo.
