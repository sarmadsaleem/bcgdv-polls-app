This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) in response to this [problem](docs/Problem.md). For brevity, state management libraries like Redux or MobX have been avoided, however for production purposes and complex use cases (user authentication, mutiple actions etc) they'll be better suited.
